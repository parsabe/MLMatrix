# PVL part IV - Game of Life from

The objective of this study is to evaluate the performance of a serial implementation of
Conway’s Game of Life under varying problem sizes. The program demonstrates computational complexity as the grid size increases by simulating a dynamic
environment where cells evolve based on their neighbors. The experiments on
grid sizes ranging from 1,000 to 8,000 provide insight into the computational costs of
solving such problems serially. The results establish a foundational benchmark for
future parallelization using MPI, highlighting the inefficiencies and limitations of
single-threaded approaches when handling large-scale data.

## Introduction

Conway’s Game of Life is a cellular automaton that models the evolution of cells on a
grid based on predefined rules of life and death. This simulation is widely used in
computational science to study complex systems and assess algorithmic efficiency. In
the current implementation, a serial approach is employed to process grids of
increasing sizes, measuring performance and computation times for a fixed number of
iterations. While this method provides a straightforward solution, it lacks scalability,
especially for larger problem domains. The findings from this study aim to establish a
baseline for optimization efforts, paving the way for distributed computing strategies
such as MPI to overcome the limitations observed in single-threaded environments.

## Program Description

The program is a serial implementation of Conway's Game of Life, designed to
simulate the evolution of a grid-based cellular automaton where each cell's state (alive
or dead) is determined by its neighbors' states according to predefined rules. The
program accepts three inputs: the grid size (N), the number of timesteps, and the initial
probability of a cell being alive. It initializes the grid with random states, updates the
grid iteratively for the specified timesteps, and calculates alive neighbors for each cell
to determine its next state. The program uses padding to handle boundary conditions
and outputs the grid state for small sizes, along with the total computation time for
performance evaluation. This implementation establishes a baseline for understanding
the computational cost of the task in a single-threaded environment.

## Part A

Running the code

In the C++ code, we have to implement in two ways:

```bash
g++ -std=c++11 -O3 game_of_life.cpp -o game_of_life. #For compiling.
./game_of_life <N> 10 0.5. #For executing with a number of N such as 1000
```

    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>


### Output Analysis

The results from Part A demonstrate a clear relationship between the problem size N
and the computation time, highlighting the quadratic nature of the algorithm due to the
two-dimensional grid structure of the Game of Life. As the grid size increases, the
total number of cells, and thus the computational workload, grows proportionally to
𝑁^2. This is evident from the observed execution times, where doubling (N)
approximately quadruples the computation time. For instance, the jump from N=
to N= 2000 results in a nearly 4x increase in execution time, going from 0.0556 seconds
to 0.221 seconds. Similarly, further increments in (N) maintain this scaling pattern,
though the slight deviations can be attributed to system overheads or memory access
inefficiencies in handling larger datasets. These results underline the limitations of a
single-threaded, serial implementation, especially as the problem size grows. With
larger grids like N=8000, the computation time surpasses 4.5 seconds even for a
modest 10 timesteps, indicating that the algorithm would struggle to handle
significantly larger grids or higher timestep counts without optimizations. This makes
the case for parallelization particularly compelling, as distributing the workload across
multiple processors could reduce individual computation loads and dramatically
improve execution times. These findings emphasize the necessity of transitioning to a
parallel implementation for practical scalability, especially when working with larger
grids in real-world scenarios.

## Part B

### Running the code

In the C++ code, we have to implement in two ways:

```bash
mpic++ -std=c++11 -O3 game_of_life_mpi.cpp -o game_of_life_mpi. #Compile it with MPI.

mpirun -np <num_processes> ./game_of_life_mpi <N> <timesteps> <probability>. #Running it with MPI.
```

### Program description

The program implemented in Part B focuses on parallelizing the Game of Life
simulation using MPI (Message Passing Interface) to enhance performance for large
problem sizes. The simulation divides the board into rows, which are distributed
evenly among multiple MPI processes. Each process handles a subset of the rows,
including additional "halo" rows that store boundary information needed for
communication with neighboring processes. The program employs MPI functions such
as MPI_Sendrecv to exchange these halo rows, ensuring that each process has the
necessary data to compute the next timestep accurately. The program begins by
initializing the board with a random distribution of alive and dead cells, followed by
iteratively computing timesteps based on Conway's Game of Life rules. Processes
update their assigned rows and exchange halo data with neighboring processes to
maintain consistency across the board. The program includes both strong and weak
scaling capabilities, allowing users to evaluate its performance by either fixing the
problem size and varying the number of processes or increasing the problem size
proportionally with the processes to maintain a constant workload per process. Despite
the parallelization, the results highlight challenges with communication overhead and
inefficiencies in scaling, particularly as the number of processes increases. The
program emphasizes the importance of synchronization and data consistency in
parallel computations while demonstrating the potential for performance
improvements through optimized MPI communication and better workload
distribution.

### Output Analysis

The results from the MPI implementation reveal a substantial reduction in computation
time compared to the serial version, with speedup factors ranging from ~2.89 for (N =
1000 ) to ~ 4.88 for (N = 8000). The parallel implementation's effectiveness increases
with the problem size, as seen in the growing speedup factors. This is expected
because the workload per process grows with larger grids, making the overhead of
halo communication relatively smaller compared to the total computation. For (N =
1000 ), the communication overhead is more significant, slightly dampening the
parallel performance. However, as the grid size increases, the program benefits more
from dividing the workload among the 4 MPI processes. The time improvements
demonstrate that the program scales well and efficiently utilize the 4 processes, with
the parallel implementation achieving nearly 5x speedup for the largest grid size tested
(N = 8000). This indicates that the MPI implementation is well-suited for handling
larger datasets, where the computational cost dominates over communication
overhead.

### Output analysis
The strong scaling results reveal that the parallel implementation does not scale
efficiently as the number of processes increases. Ideally, computation time should
decrease significantly with more processes. However, in this case, the computation
time remains nearly constant (~4.5 seconds) regardless of the number of processes,
resulting in low speed-up and efficiency values. For 2 processes, the speedup is only
0.97, with efficiency at 48%, which drops further to 0.95 and 11% efficiency for 8
processes. This suggests that the parallel implementation faces significant communication overhead or poor load balancing, which negates the benefits of adding more processes. The lack of improvement in computation time indicates that either the
problem size is too small relative to the number of processes or that the halo
communication between processes is inefficient.

      <td>4.74223</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### Output Analysis
The weak scaling results indicate poor scalability as the number of processes
increases. In a well-optimized weak scaling scenario, the computation time should
remain constant because the workload per process remains fixed at 1000 cells.
However, the computation time increases significantly as the number of processes
increases: from 0.063 seconds for 1 process to 4.742 seconds for 8 processes. This
suggests that the parallel implementation is heavily impacted by communication
overhead, as the halo exchange between processes increases with more processes. The
results indicate that the parallel efficiency of the implementation deteriorates rapidly in
weak scaling, likely due to the increased cost of synchronizing boundary rows.

## Conclusion

This project showcases the use of parallel computing to optimize the Game of Life
simulation. Part A highlights the increasing computational demand with larger grid
sizes in serial implementation, emphasizing the need for parallelization. Part B
introduces an MPI-based solution, distributing the workload among processes and
using halo communication for synchronization. Part C evaluates the performance
through strong and weak scaling, revealing limitations in efficiency due to
communication overhead and load balancing.
