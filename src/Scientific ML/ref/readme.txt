1. Brunton, Proctor, Kutz (2016) ‚Äî SINDy Paper

Reference:
https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1517384113

‚úÖ Read carefully:

    Abstract

    Introduction

    "Sparse regression for model selection" (Section on Methodology)

    Figures that show how SINDy works

    Examples (especially how they recover differential equations)

‚ùå Skip:

    Proofs, deep math derivations (they are not needed for your project)

Summary:
Focus on understanding the idea: finding sparse equations from data.
2. PySINDy Library Documentation

Reference:
https://pysindy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

‚úÖ Read carefully:

    Installation and basic example

    Tutorials:

        "SINDy on simulated data"

        "Sparse regression models"

        "Derivative approximation"

‚ùå Skip:

    Advanced customizations (e.g., control systems, implicit SINDy)

Summary:
Focus on how to apply PySINDy practically to your crypto time series.
3. Ruey S. Tsay ‚Äî Analysis of Financial Time Series

Reference:
https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-e&channel=entpr&q=Analysis+of+Financial+Time+Series

‚úÖ Read carefully (only summaries or slides are fine if book is too long):

    Chapter 1: Introduction to Financial Time Series

    Chapter 2: Basic Time Series Concepts

    (Optional bonus) Chapter 3: Modeling Financial Return Series

‚ùå Skip:

    Deep GARCH models, multivariate analysis, if it feels too heavy

Summary:
You need only basic financial data properties: returns, volatility, stationarity.

‚úÖ Read carefully:

    Chapter 2: Financial Data Structures

    Chapter 5: Feature Engineering and Selection

    Chapter 10 (optional): Bet Sizing (profit-maximizing ideas)

‚ùå Skip:

    Backtesting overfitting, meta-labeling, too technical trading strategy chapters

Summary:
Use this to create good input features (momentum, volatility, moving averages) before running SINDy.
üìã Summary Table (Quick View)
Reference	What to Focus On	What to Skip
Brunton et al. (2016)	Intro + Sparse Regression + Examples	Proofs
PySINDy Docs	Tutorials (basic usage, sparse modeling)	Deep customizations
Ruey S. Tsay	Basics of Financial Time Series (returns, volatility)	Deep GARCH/multivariate models
L√≥pez de Prado	Feature Engineering Chapters	Overfitting/backtesting heavy parts

‚úÖ If you follow only these parts, you will understand everything you need for your project.
‚úÖ You don't waste time reading too much unnecessary theory.
‚úÖ You finish faster and look professional.
